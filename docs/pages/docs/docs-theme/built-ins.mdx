# Built-ins

import { CardsIcon } from '@components/icons'
import { Card, Cards } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

The Nextra Docs Theme includes a couple of built-in components that you can use
to better style your documentation:

<Cards>
  <Card
    icon={<CardsIcon />}
    title="Bleed"
    href="/docs/docs-theme/built-ins/bleed"
  />
</Cards>
