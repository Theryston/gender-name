# Cloning

The repository contains the trained models, this means that the clone may take a little longer and the project may weigh more due to the models. Remember to have [LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) installed before running the clone.

Full command (install LFS and clone):

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://github.com/Theryston/gender-name.git
```
