## Detailed API Usage Instructions

To use the Gender Name API it is very simple, just make a request to `POST /predict` passing the `name` and `model` in the body, below is the more detailed request:

**Endpoint:**

```bash
POST https://api.gendername.com/predict
```

**Body:**

```json
{
    "name": "{person_name}",
    "model": "{model_name}"
}
